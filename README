We decided to implement the command stream in an array form (an array of commands), 
with the idea that we'd eventually sort the array as if it were a binary tree, to account
for the different priority levels of different commands. However, we ran out
of time before we could finish that implementation.

See you in office hours, because we sure as hell need it.
